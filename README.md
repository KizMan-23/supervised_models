supervised model is a machine learning approach which is trained by using pre-labelled data to predict on unseen data.

TYPES OF SUPERVISED TECHNIQUES
1. Classification
2. Regression

Supervised_Models contains projects that have utilized either of the two types of supervised techniques to predict on unseen data. In [nba_data](nba_data.ipynb) and [nba_cleaning](nba_cleaning_1.ipynb), NBA dataset is loaded into jupyter notebook, using python frameworks like pandas, the data was prepared and cleaned to be usable for futhur model training and prediction

cleaning dataset is a very important stage for data uniformity, offering consistency in data used for training and testing models.
